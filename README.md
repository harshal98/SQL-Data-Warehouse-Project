# Data Warehouse Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and the movement of data through different layers of a data warehouse. It showcases how raw data is extracted from source systems, transformed into a structured and meaningful format, and finally loaded into a data warehouse for reporting and analytics.
