# Data Warehouse Project
This project demonstrates the implementation of an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process and the movement of data through different layers of a data warehouse. It showcases how raw data is extracted from source systems, transformed into a structured and meaningful format, and finally loaded into a data warehouse for reporting and analytics.

## Data Architecture

The data architecture for this project follows Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers:
![Data Architecture](docs/DataWarehouse.png)
1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. **Silver Layer**: This layer includes data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes to prepare data for analysis.
3. **Gold Layer**: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema required for reporting and analytics.

## ðŸ“– Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Architecture**: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse Using Medallion Architecture **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.
3. **Data Modeling**: Developing fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.
4. **Analytics & Reporting**: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.



#### Objective

#### Specifications
- **Data Sources**: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.
- **Data Quality**: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.
- **Integration**: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.
- **Scope**: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.
- **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.
